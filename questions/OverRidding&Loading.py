# Overloading is when you have the same function name that takes different parameters.

# Overriding is when a child class replaces a parent's method with one of its own (this in iteself does not constitute polymorphism). super.methodName()

# Polymorphism is late binding, e.g. the base class (parent) methods are being called but not until runtime does the application know what the actual object is - it may be a child class whose methods are different. This is because any child class can be used where a base class is defined.
