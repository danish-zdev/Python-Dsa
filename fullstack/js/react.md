### React:
1. **React Basics:**
   - **What is the virtual DOM, and how does React use it?**
     - The virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. React uses it to efficiently update the UI by diffing the virtual DOM with the real DOM and applying only the necessary changes.
   - **Explain the difference between a class component and a functional component.**
     - Class components use ES6 classes and can hold state and lifecycle methods. Functional components are simpler and can now use hooks to manage state and lifecycle methods.
   - **How do you manage state in a React application?**
     - State can be managed using the `useState` hook in functional components, `this.state` and `this.setState` in class components, or using state management libraries like Redux or Context API for global state.
   - **What are props in React? How do they differ from state?**
     - Props are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components. State is a mutable data store managed within a component.
   - **Explain the purpose of `useEffect` and provide an example of how you have used it.**
     - `useEffect` is used for performing side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations. Example: Fetching data on component mount.
     ```javascript
     useEffect(() => {
       fetch('api/data')
         .then(response => response.json())
         .then(data => setData(data));
     }, []);
     ```

2. **Advanced React:**
   - **Explain the component life cycle in react?**
     - The component lifecycle includes mounting (componentDidMount, useEffect with empty dependencies), updating (componentDidUpdate, useEffect with dependencies), and unmounting (componentWillUnmount, useEffect cleanup function).
   - **What are hooks, and why were they introduced in React?**
     - Hooks are functions that allow using state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced to simplify the code and avoid the complexity of class components.
   - **Explain the concept of higher-order components (HOCs).**
     - HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behaviors for code reuse and logic abstraction.
   - **How do you optimize performance in a React application?**
     - Use `React.memo` for memoization, avoid unnecessary re-renders, use code-splitting, lazy loading, and optimize component rendering.
   - **What is React Context API, and when should you use it?**
     - Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is used for global state management.
   - **How do you handle forms in React?**
     - Forms are handled using controlled components, with state managed via `useState` and input fields tied to state values. Libraries like Formik can also be used for more complex forms.

3. **React Ecosystem:**
   - **What is Redux, and how does it integrate with React?**
     - Redux is a state management library for managing global state. It integrates with React through the `react-redux` library, which provides hooks and HOCs to connect components to the Redux store.
   - **How do you handle side effects in Redux?**
     - Side effects in Redux are handled using middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga, which allow for async operations and complex logic.
   - **Explain React Router and how you manage routing in a React application.**
     - React Router is a library for managing navigation and routing in a React application. Routes are defined using components like `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Link`, and `Switch`.
   - **How do you perform unit testing in React? Which testing libraries have you used?**
     - Unit testing in React is done using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library. Jest provides the testing framework, while React Testing Library provides utilities to test React components.
   - **What is Next.js, and how does it benefit a React application?**
     - Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. It improves performance, SEO, and developer experience.
