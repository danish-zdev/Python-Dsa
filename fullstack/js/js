7. **JavaScript in the Browser:**
   - What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how do you manipulate it using JavaScript?
   - Explain the concept of event delegation in JavaScript.
   - What are the common methods to select DOM elements? Compare `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `getElementsByClassName`.
   - What is `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` in JavaScript? How are they different?

8. **Modern JavaScript (ES6+):**

   - What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from traditional functions?
   - What are spread and rest operators in JavaScript? How are they used?
   - What are modules in JavaScript? How do `import` and `export` work?

### Practical JavaScript Coding Questions

1. **DOM Manipulation:**
   - Write a function to create a new DOM element and append it to an existing element.
   - Create a JavaScript function that toggles the visibility of an element when a button is clicked.
   - Write a script that changes the background color of a webpage when the user clicks a button.

2. **Array Manipulation:**
   - Given an array of numbers, write a function to return the sum of all the numbers.
   - Write a function that takes an array and returns a new array with only the unique elements.
   - Implement a function that sorts an array of numbers in ascending order.

3. **String Manipulation:**
   - Write a function to reverse a given string.
   - Implement a function to check if a string is a palindrome.
   - Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of every word in a string.

4. **Asynchronous Programming:**
   - Write a function that uses `fetch` to get data from an API and displays it on the webpage.
   - Create a countdown timer using `setTimeout` or `setInterval` that counts down from a specified number.
   - Write an example of how to handle multiple asynchronous operations in sequence using Promises.

5. **Object-Oriented Programming:**
   - Create a simple class in JavaScript that represents a `Car`. Include properties like `make`, `model`, and `year`, and methods like `start` and `stop`.
   - Extend the `Car` class to create a `ElectricCar` class that adds a `batteryLevel` property and a method to charge the car.
   - Implement a `Book` class with properties like `title`, `author`, and methods like `getSummary`.

6. **Event Handling:**
   - Create an event listener that listens for a click event on a button and displays an alert.
   - Write a function that changes the text of a paragraph when the mouse hovers over it.
   - Implement a form validation function that checks if the input fields are filled out and display appropriate error messages.

7. **Functional Programming:**
   - Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an array of the squares of those numbers using `map`.
   - Implement a function that filters out all even numbers from an array using `filter`.
   - Create a function that calculates the product of an array of numbers using `reduce`.

### Advanced Practical Exercises (Optional)

1. **Debounce Function:**
   - Write a debounce function that delays invoking a function until after a specified wait time has elapsed since the last time the function was invoked.

2. **Deep Clone:**
   - Implement a function to deep clone a JavaScript object.

3. **Promise.all Implementation:**
   - Write a function that mimics the behavior of `Promise.all`.

### Preparing for the Interview

- **Practice Coding:** Make sure you are comfortable coding in JavaScript without relying on IDEs or autocomplete features.
- **Understand the Basics:** Ensure you have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of JavaScript. Interviewers often focus on concepts like closures, scopes, and asynchronous programming.
- **Solve Problems:** Use platforms like LeetCode, Codewars, or HackerRank to practice solving JavaScript problems.
- **Project Experience:** Be ready to discuss any projects youâ€™ve worked on, explaining the decisions you made, the challenges you faced, and how you solved them.
- **Brush Up on ES6+ Features:** Modern JavaScript features like destructuring, spread/rest operators, arrow functions, and async/await are commonly discussed in interviews.
  
Being well-prepared in both practical and theoretical aspects of JavaScript will give you a solid foundation to excel in your interview. Good luck!
