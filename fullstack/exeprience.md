### Start with a Brief Overview
"I've been working as a Python/Django Developer for a little over two years now, focusing primarily on building applications for the healthcare sector and data science tools."

### Current Role: Ichelon Consulting Group
"In my most recent position at Ichelon Consulting Group, which I joined in May 2023, I've been involved in developing software solutions for healthcare clients. One of the projects I’m particularly proud of is a **Lead Management System**. It helps telecallers manage leads from various sources like Facebook ads and landing pages. This system has really streamlined how our clients handle their lead generation."

This allows clients to analyze massive amounts of event data, which helps them understand visitor behavior on their sites better. It’s rewarding to see how these tools can directly impact their marketing strategies."

I enjoyed the challenge of web scraping and automation, which helped us gather and process data more efficiently."

### Internship Experience: Panalink Infotech
