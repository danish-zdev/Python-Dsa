// - **`var`:** It is function-scoped and can be re-declared and updated. It's hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized with `undefined`.
  
// - **`let`:** It is block-scoped and cannot be re-declared within the same block, but it can be updated. Unlike `var`, it is not initialized, so referencing it before the declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

// - **`const`:** It is also block-scoped like `let`, but it cannot be updated or re-declared. Itâ€™s used to define variables that are constants (cannot be reassigned).



// var and let create variables that can be reassigned another value.
// const creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value.
// developers shouldn't use var anymore. They should use let or const instead.
// if you're not going to change the value of a variable, it is good practice to use const.
