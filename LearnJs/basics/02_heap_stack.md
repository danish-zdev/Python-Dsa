Sure! Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation:

### Memory Types

1. **Stack Memory**:
   - Used for **primitive values** (like numbers and strings) and function calls.
   - Holds quick-access data.

2. **Heap Memory**:
   - Used for **non-primitive values** (like objects and arrays).
   - Suitable for dynamic memory allocation.

### Shallow Copy
- **Stack**: Holds references to primitive values and the top-level object.
- **Heap**: The top-level object is new, but nested objects are shared (point to the same memory as the original).

### Deep Copy
- **Stack**: Holds references to primitive values.
- **Heap**: Both the top-level object and all nested objects are new and independent.

### Summary
- **Shallow Copy**: Shares nested objects; uses less memory.
- **Deep Copy**: Creates new nested objects; uses more memory.
